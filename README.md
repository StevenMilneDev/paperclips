# Universal Paperclips Mirror
This is a mirror of the incremental clicker game [Universal Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) created by [Frank Lantz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lantz) in 2017 to help him learn Javascript. In Universal Paperclips you take the role of an AI which produces and sells paperclips, the goal of the game is to make as many paperclips as possible... Even if this requires the eradication of the human race to maximise paperclip production.

Universal Paperclips is a strangely addictive game! I wanted to make this mirror so that I could always play it even if the original version was taken down. The game is written in Javascript using HTML inputs to interact with it.

## Building
The original version of Paperclips was hosted in an Apache web server, this mirror instead uses a simple NodeJS HTTP server. To run the server you must first install the dependencies using NPM, you can do this by typing the following command into the terminal when you are in the root directory of this repository;

> `npm install`

Once the dependencies have been installed you can run the server by typing the following command in the terminal;

> `npm start`

This will start the HTTP server allowing you to play the game in your web browser at the address [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). When you are finished with the server you can press CTRL+C while in the terminal to stop the server.
